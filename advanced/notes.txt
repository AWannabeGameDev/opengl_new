Render loop right now -
1. Render scene through each light source individually
		- Potential for batching different light sources with same type together
	- Set matrix
	- Attach shadow map to FBO
	- Draw scene
2. Render scene to FBO
	- Set view matrix and view position
	- Set light space matrices
		- Separate arrays for different light source types
	- Set light source structs
		- Separate arrays for different light source types
	- Set shadow maps
		- Potential for batching different light sources with same type together
	- Set texture maps and batch render objects with same textures individually
		- Potential for batching different textures together via texture-arrays
	- Render skybox
3. Post processing (Render FBO to default framebuffer)
